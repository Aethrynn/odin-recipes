    <h3 class="header" id="description">Description</h3>
    <p>A traditional holiday table wouldn't be complete without a sweet potato casserole. Perfectly flavored and topped with an irresistible pecan topping, this is the only sweet potato casserole recipe you'll ever need.</p>
    <p>You can prepare this sweet potato casserole one to two days in advance. It's a great way to get a head start on Thanksgiving! To make ahead, simply prepare the filling and topping separately â€” but don't bake anything yet. Tightly cover the baking dish and place the topping in an airtight container. Store them both in the refrigerator until you're ready to cook.</p>
    <p>On the big day, sprinkle the topping onto the filling and bake according to the directions (you may have to add a few minutes to the baking time to account for the cold temperature).</p>
