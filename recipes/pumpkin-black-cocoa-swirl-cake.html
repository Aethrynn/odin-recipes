        <li>6 tablespoons of heavy cream, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 12-cup Bundt pan with a baking spray containing flour, such as Baker's Joy</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another large bowl, beat butter, oil, and 2 cupers white sugar on medium-high speed with an electric mixer until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add in eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. After adding in the last egg, beat mixture on medium-high speed until doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Add in pumpkin and vanilla, and mix until incorporated. Reduce mixer speed to low; pour in half of dry ingredients, and mix until just combined. Add in sour cream; mix until just combined. Add in remaining dry ingredients and mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Measure out 3 cups batter into another bowl. To this 3 cups batter, add 3 tablespoon black cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons of sugar, milk, espresso powder (if desired), and melted semi-sweet chocolate. Mix on low speed until combined.</li>
        <li>Place 1/3 of black cocoa batter into an even layer in the bottom of the prepared Bundt pan. Pour 1/2 of plain pumpkin batter over the black cocoa layer. Add another 1/3 of black cocoa batter over the top of the plain pumpkin batter. Layer the remaining 1/2 of plain pumpkin batter over that. Finish with the remianing 1/3 of the black cocoa batter.</li>
        <li>Bake cake in the preheated oven until a bamboo skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out mostly clean, 60 to 65 minutes. Allow cake to cool in pan 25 to 30 minutes before inverting on a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>To make icing, place powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons black cocoa, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, pinch of salt, and heavy cream into a bowl. Whisk until smooth. Drizzle icing over cooled cake.</li>
